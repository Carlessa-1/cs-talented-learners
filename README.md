## 🌐 Web Pages

### 🏠 Home Page
The **Home page** welcomes visitors into the cozy world of *Koneko Kape*, a warm aesthetic that blends cats, coffee, and pastries. A nav bar at the top allows users to explore other sections of the website easily. The main banner will feature a rotating image carousel that showcases signature drinks, treats, to entice visitors. Below the banner, a short introduction to the cafe will highlight its comforting charm. The footer contains social media links and a copyright tag. 

### 🍰 Recipe Page
The **Recipe page** will include a list of items, each with their own respective subpages where it shows step-by-step instructions and a small interactive clicker-style minigame inspired by *Cooking Mama*. Users can click to add ingredients, mix, brew, or bake in the correct order while a progress bar fills up as they complete each step. Finishing the recipe rewards users with an animated “Success!” pop-up and a share button to post their results. These subpages can be accessed via the Home Page item carousel, and recipe tab by clicking the images of said item. 

### 🐱 About Us Page
The **About Us page** tells the story behind the *Koneko Kape*, how it began as a small online cafe built by coffee and cat lovers. It features a timeline of the cafe’s development, a mission and vision section, and a short intro for the mascot, represented by an illustrated cat that matches the cozy theme. The footer contains social media links and copyright tag. 

### 💬 Contact Page
The **Contact page** offers visitors an easy way to reach out to the Koneko Kape team. It includes a simple form where users can input their name, email, and message. Once a user submits a form, a thank-you message appears to confirm the receipt. 

### 📚 Reference and Gallery Page
The **Reference & Gallery page** serves as both a credit section and a relaxing visual feature of Koneko Kape. The upper half of the page lists all references, sources, and inspirations used throughout the website. This provides proper acknowledgment while maintaining a clean and organized format.
Below the references, the page transitions into a cat-themed image carousel,, similar to the one in the homepage. This is a fun and heartwarming gallery of adorable cafe cats, latte art, and pastries. Visitors can manually scroll through the image carousel, a simple and entertaining way to create a *cozy and nice atmosphere*.

## 💻 How JavaScript Will Be Used
**JavaScript** will be used throughout the Koneko Kape website to enhance user interactivity and visual appeal. It will control image carousels on both the Home and Reference & Gallery pages, allowing manual transitions using navigation arrows. In the Recipe subpages, JavaScript powers the interactive minigame, enabling step-by-step click actions, progress tracking, and animated success pop-ups. On the Contact Page, JavaScript validates the form by checking for empty fields and ensuring valid email formatting before submission. It also triggers a custom pop-up message that thanks users for reaching out.
